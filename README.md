## âœ¨ Introduction

Due to issues such as data privacy and acquisition difficulties, existing large-scale time series datasets face severe data shortages and imbalanced distribution compared to images and natural language. Foundation models pre-trained on these datasets will have certain prediction biases, reducing their generalization and robustness.

Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a [series-symbol](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator) data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop **SymTime**, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information, which demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets.

## ðŸ§­ Quickstart

### Installation

First create a Python virtual environment (preferably version 3.10.15), then install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

SymTime relies on a large-scale series-symbol bimodal dataset generated by [S2Generator](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator) during pre-training. You can generate the data required for pre-training by executing the following script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/s2generator.sh
```

For the fine-tuning datasets, you can load from [OneDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACYD_RxQMPZ4DzHDdB3xkRHCkE8FcdH2?usp=sharing) or [BaiduCloud](). Then place the downloaded datasets under the folder `./datasets`.

### Model Pre-Train and Fine-Tune

Once you have generated enough time series data using [`S2Generator`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator), you can pre-train SymTime by executing our pre-training script:

```shell
bash ./scripts/SymTime_pretrain.sh
```

If you want to skip the time-consuming pre-training phase, you can directly download our pre-trained model parameters and put them under `./models/params/` for fine-tuning on downstream tasks:

```shell
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecasting/SymTime_ECL.sh

bash ./scripts/short_term_forecasting/SymTime_M4.sh

bash ./scripts/classification/SymTime_EthanolConcentration.sh

bash ./scripts/imputation/SymTime_ECL.sh

bash ./scripts/anomaly_detection/test/MSL.sh
```

### Main Results


### Benchmark Results

Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We show the main results of all the 10 real-world datasets, and report the mean results of the 6 types of synthetic datasets:
